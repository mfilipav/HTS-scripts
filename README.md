# Processing and analyzing High Throuhput Sequencing (HTS) data of immune cells / CDR3s

## compare_immune_repertoire
Compares CDR3 -- immune cell receptor that mediates discovery of pathogens -- population statistics across multiple samples

## analyze_mixcr and analyze_imgt
Clean-up the immune gene annotation files (from software called MIXCR). Find the most dominant CDR3s, antibody frequency distributions, plot diversity estimate models.

## find_illumina_indices
There's 48 unique Illumina sequencing indeces (RNA PCR Index Primers, RPI1â€“RPI48). Enter the desired Primer ID and the correct DNA sequence is returned!
